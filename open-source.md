# Spoon/Spoon Standalone

Spoon is a C# library which provides SEO for Single Page ASP.NET Applications. It generates snapshots of each dynamic page in your site, and serves them up to search engines in accordance with Google's [escaped fragment protocol](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification).

Spoon Standalone serves the same purpose as Spoon, but runs separate from your web application. It is mainly useful if your web app is hosted in an Azure Web Site, as such applications cannot spawn additional processes: a key requirement of using Spoon. Spoon Standalone is written in Node.js.
