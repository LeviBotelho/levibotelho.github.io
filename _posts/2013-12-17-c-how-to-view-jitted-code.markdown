We spend a lot of time in these posts looking at the CIL that is generated by the C# compiler. But did you know that you can actually go a level deeper and view the assembly code generated by the JITter?

## 1. Run your program into a breakpoint

## 2. Go to DEBUG ➙ WINDOWS ➙ DISASSEMBLY

## 3. View your disassembled code

Easy!
