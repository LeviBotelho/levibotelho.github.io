In my office we have a fridge and freezer stocked with drinks and ice cream. People can come by and for a small fee purchase one of the products that we have to offer. Formerly, our colleagues paid by using custom-engraved tokens that we sold for a small fee. This system worked well enough, but earlier this year I sat down with Beno√Æt, a colleague of mine, to design a simple, flexible, and open source RFID-based payment system as a replacement.
