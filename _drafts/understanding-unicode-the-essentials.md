Understanding Unicode - The Essentials

Character encoding is one of those concepts that everybody seems to know just enough about to get by. It's unfortunate that this is the the case, however, because by getting a grasp of the fundamentals of how it works, you can save yourself a lot of head-scratching down the road where you need to do something more complicated than transform a character into its numerical equivalent.

## In the beginning there was ASCII
ASCII (the American Standard Code for Information Interchange) standard was born way back in 1963 for use in teletype machines. Each character was 7 bits long, giving the format a total of 128 different possibilities. For English text, this was more than enough, allowing for uppercase and lowercase versions of the 26-character alphabet, as well as punctuation marks and a bunch of control characters.
