Hi, I'm Levi Botelho. I spend my days doing C# and F# development in the financial services industry, but off the clock I tend to mix in a lot of frontend JavaScript.

I write this blog primarily to share solutions to challenges that I've encountered while developing with as wide an audience as possible. Most of the posts are .NET or web related, but the content really varies depending on what I'm working on at any given moment and can touch on stuff like databases, source control, and mobile development.

If you want to get in touch with me you can either send me an email at [levi.botelho+blog@gmail.com](mailto:levi.botelho+blog@gmail.com) or shoot me a message on Twitter at [@LeviBotelho](https://twitter.com/LeviBotelho).
