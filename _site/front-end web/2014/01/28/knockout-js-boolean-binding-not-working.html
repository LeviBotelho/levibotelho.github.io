<p>Here's a quick fix if you’re doing data binding in knockout and wondering why a binding like the following isn’t working:</p><p>[html]<br />
&lt;div data-bind=&quot;visible: !isMessageHidden&quot;&gt;</p><p>&lt;script&gt;<br />
// In your view model<br />
self.isMessageHidden: ko.observable(true) };<br />
// ...<br />
&lt;/script&gt;<br />
[/html]</p><p>You need to add a set of parentheses after the <code>isMessageHidden</code> like so.</p><p>[html]<br />
&lt;div data-bind=&quot;visible: !isMessageHidden()&quot;&gt;<br />
[/html]</p><p>The key to understanding this is understanding that <code>isMessageHidden</code> is not a boolean value, but an observable which stores a boolean value. If we simply refer to this observable by name in our data-binding code, then knockout will infer that we want to retrieve the stored value. However, if we wish to refer to the stored value within a statement, such as <code>!isMessageHidden()</code>, then the parentheses are required in order to indicate that we want the stored value and not the observable itself. This tripped me up a few times when I was learning knockout. Hope this helps somebody!</p>
