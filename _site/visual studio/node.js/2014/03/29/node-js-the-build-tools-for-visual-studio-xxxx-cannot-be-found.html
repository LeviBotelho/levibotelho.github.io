<p>I got this error when trying to install a node.js package that wanted to build some associated .cc files with the Visual Studio 2010 compiler (v100 build tools). I haven't had Visual Studio 2010 installed on my machine since Visual Studio 2012 came out, and <em>really</em> didn't want to reinstall it.</p><p>It turns out that the solution to this is quite simple. You simply need to add the following argument to your install command.</p><p>[powershell]<br />
--msvs_version=2013<br />
[/powershell]</p><p>Your install command will therefore look like this.</p><p>[powershell]<br />
npm install [pkg] -S --msvs_version=2013<br />
[/powershell]</p>
