<p>Today I made my first suggestion on Visual Studio User Voice. My request is simple. I would like the Visual Studio design team to change the Browser Link icon from a clockwise arrow to something else, such as a bidirectional horizontal arrow. Here's why.</p><p><a href='http://www.levibotelho.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Browser-Link-Button.png'><img alt='Browser Link Button' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-5671' height='40' src='http://www.levibotelho.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Browser-Link-Button.png' width='745' /></a></p><p>I am constantly getting these buttons mixed up, which is not helped by the fact that the browser link button is right beside the Start Debugging button. If you agree, then do feel free to <a href='http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/5771039-change-the-browser-link-icon'>vote on Visual Studio User Voice for this issue</a>.</p>
