      <p>üçπ <a href="https://www.mai-tai.app">Mai Tai</a> ‚Äî Mai Tai turns mountains of text into the answers that you're
        searching for. Upload any document or web page and Mai Tai will read it and answer questions about its contents.
        It's fantastic for students studying for exams, professionals dealing with piles of technical documentation, or
        really with too much to read and not enough time.

        Mai Tai is free to use, and doesn't even require an account to get started. Give it a try and let me know what
        you think!
